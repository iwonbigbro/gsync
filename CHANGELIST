gsync 0.1.0:

 * Traversal of the Google drive is now more reliable and requires less CPU
   and network requests.
 
 * Intermediate directory creation now occurs through a restructure of the
   directory walking code, ensuring directories are provided to the callback.
 
 * Itemized output now occurs without needing to specify the verbose option.

 * Interrupt handling now works, so Ctrl-C will halt the sync and output the
   progress (bytes sent/received) up to the interrupt.

 * Implemented --progress functionality so that upload progress can be
   monitored.

 * Fixed Bug: "Syncs one file and crashes with division by zero error"

 * Fixed Bug: "Always: Error: String or Integer object expected for key,
               unicode found"
 
 * Fixed Bug: "BUG: Files get updated that are in Trash and do not get
               restored."
