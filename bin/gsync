gsync is a file transfer program based on the rsync file transfer program.
The only functional difference is that gsync is intended to be used for
synchronising between a source directory and remote Google Drive directory.

Usage:
 gsync [options] <path> <path>...

Arguments:
 <path>                      path to a local file, directory, remote file or 
                             remote directory.  The last argument in the list
                             of provided paths is considered the destination.
                             The destination must be specified along with at
                             least one source.  If a source or destination is
                             remote, then it must be specified in the form:

                                drive:///some/folder

                             any local file or directory can be specified by
                             absolute path or relative to the current working
                             directory.
